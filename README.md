This project aim to train a GAN model to generate landscape image from a textual description.
It is inspired by the work of https://github.com/paarthneekhara/text-to-image

The following is the model architecture. The blue bars represent the Skip Thought Vectors for the captions.

Image Source : [Generative Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis][2] Paper

## Requirements
- Python 2.7.6
- [Tensorflow][4]
- [h5py][5]
- [scikit-learn][7] 
- [NLTK][8]

## Datasets
- The model is currently trained on a home-made dataset with pictures and caption from a website. 

## Usage
- <b>Dataset</b>
  * Scrap image's url and caption with unsplash_webscrapping.py
  * Download image with load_image.py
      
- <b>Generating Images and Captions vectorization</b>
  * Write the captions in text file, and save it as ```Data/sample_captions.txt```. Generate the skip thought vectors for these captions using:
  ```
  python generate_thought_vectors.py --caption_file="Data/sample_captions.txt"
  ```
  * Generate the Images for the thought vectors using:
  ```
  python process_images.py
  ```
  
- <b>Training</b>
  * Basic usage `python train.py`
  * 

## Sample Images Generated
Following are the images generated by the generative model from the captions.
